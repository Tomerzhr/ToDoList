Welcome dear visitor,
The next project is a to-do list project that was created using Html, Javascript, Css.
This is a very simple Javascript project that is probably found in every portfolio of the average developer.
The project contains functions of adding a task and editing it and when it is done it marks that it has been done and all this with the help of a design that is accessible and intuitive to the user.
I hope you will be impressed by my project and with any questions do not hesitate to contact me through my portfolio website.
